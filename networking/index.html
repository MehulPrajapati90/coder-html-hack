                            connected to a network. It allows devices to identify and communicate with each other.
                            IP addresses come in two versions: IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses, and IPv6, which uses
                            128-bit addresses to accommodate the growing number of devices worldwide.

                            Internet. DNS operates through a hierarchical system of servers that respond to queries,
                            cache results, and ensure fast and reliable resolution of domain names worldwide.

                            A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface
                            card (NIC) of a device. It operates at the data link layer of the network, allowing hardware
                            to be uniquely recognized within a local network. MAC addresses are usually represented in
                            hexadecimal format.

                            web traffic uses port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS, while file transfers may use port 21
                            for FTP.
                            Ports help the operating system direct incoming and outgoing data to the correct
