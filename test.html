In HTML, a table is used to display data in a structured format of rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. It is created using the &lt;table&gt; element, which organizes information into rows (&lt;tr&gt;) and cells (&lt;td&gt; for normal data and &lt;th&gt; for headings). Tables are especially useful when you need to present related data side by side, such as schedules, price lists, or comparison charts. A table usually starts with an optional header row that defines the column titles, followed by multiple rows of data. You can also group sections of a table with &lt;thead&gt;, &lt;tbody&gt;, and &lt;tfoot&gt; for better structure and styling.
